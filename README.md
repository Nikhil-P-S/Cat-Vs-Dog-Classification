These are the Results I have  implemented ..
1. Training the cat and dog dataset using VGG 16 with 1 Fc layer , Learning rate 10^-4 ,batch size of training and  test dataset is 32 and 8 which gives accuracy result as 93.
2.Training the cat and dog dataset using VGG 16 with 2 Fc layer , Learning rate 10^-2 ,batch size of training and  test dataset is 64 and 16 which gives accuracy result as 90.
3.Training the cat and dog dataset using VGG 16 with 2  Fc layer , Learning rate 10^-4 ,batch size of training and  test dataset is 32 and 8 .
4. Evaluating my models knowledge on another dataset (Mamotty,Mohanlal) and gives accuracy result as 0.5 .
5. My model's knowledge is freezed except the last layer on the mamotty mohanlal dataset with 1 Fc layer , Learning rate 10^-4 ,batch size of training and  test dataset is 32 and 8 which gives accuracy result as 93.

6. Note : cat and Dog datasets for training is not uploaded due to size limit. You can also download these datasets from Kaggle.
